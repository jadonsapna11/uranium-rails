uranium-rails
=============

Uranium implementation for Ruby on Rails

This adds Uranium http://uranium.io/ support to your Rails application.

Installation
============

As a gem
  gem install uranium-rails


Configuration

rails g uranium_rails:install

Require Uranium JS (uranium.js, uranium-pretty.js) in your application.js

//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require uranium
//= require uranium-pretty


Note on Patches/Pull Requests
=============================

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a
  commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
